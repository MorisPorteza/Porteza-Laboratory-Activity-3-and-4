// AI Prompt:
// You are a junior Java developer for BeanBrew Coffee Shop, a café that wants to automate its customer rewards system. 
// Every customer earns points for every purchase. When a customer reaches 100 points, they can redeem a free drink. 
// The shop also wants to keep track of how many customers have registered in the system.
// I will be giving six instructions one at a time throughout our conversation.
// Carefully follow each one and gradually build the program step by step as new features are introduced.
// The project should consist of two Java files: Customer.java and CoffeeShop.java.
// Ensure that the code runs and compiles correctly after every update.
// After completing each step, include a clear explanation of what was added and which Java concepts were applied.
// Keep your explanations easy to follow and beginner-friendly, as if you’re teaching the basics of Java OOP.
